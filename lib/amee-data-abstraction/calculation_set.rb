# :title: Class: AMEE::DataAbstraction::CalculationSet

module AMEE
  module DataAbstraction
    
    # The <i>CalculationSet</i> class represents a collection of prototype
    # calculations (of the class <i>ProtptypeCalculation</i>.
    #
    # Prototype calculations are contained within the @calculations instance variable
    # ordered hash. Calculations can be added manually to the @calculations hash or
    # initialized in place using the <tt>#calculation</tt> method which takes an
    # options hash or block for specifying the prototype calculation properties.
    #
    # Typical usage is to initialize the <i>CalculationSet</i> and its daughter
    # prototype calculations together using block syntax, thus:
    #
    #   Calculations = CalculationSet.new {
    #
    #     calculation {
    #       label :electricity
    #       path "/some/path/for/electricity"
    #       ...
    #     }
    #
    #     calculation {
    #       label :transport
    #       path "a/transport/path"
    #       ...
    #     }
    #
    #     ...
    #   }
    #
