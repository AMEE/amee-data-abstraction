# :title: Class: AMEE::DataAbstraction::PrototypeCalculation

module AMEE
  module DataAbstraction

    # The <i>PrototypeCalculation</i> class represents a template for a potential
    # calculation within the AMEE platfom.
    # 
    # The class inherits from the <i>Calculation</i> class and is therefore primarly
    # characterised by the <tt>label</tt>, <tt>name</tt>, and <tt>path</tt> attributes,
    # as well as an associated instance of the <tt>TermsList</tt> class which represents
    # each of the values (input, outputs, metdata) involved in the calculation. Unlike
    # the <i>OngoingCalculation</i>, the terms associated with an instance of
    # <i>PrototypeCalculation</i> will typically contains blank (nil) values.
    #
    # Objects of the class <i>PrototypeCalculation</tt> are typically instantiated
    # using block ('DSL') syntax, within which each of the attributes and associated
    # terms are defined. Thus,
    #
    #   calculation = PrototypeCalculation.new {
    #
    #     label :electricity
    #     name "Domestic electricity consumption"
    #     path "some/path/in/amee"
    #     drill { ... }
    #     profile { ... }
    #     ...
    #
    #   }

      # in the context of the new instance) which defines the calculation properties
      # using the macro-style instance helper methods.
