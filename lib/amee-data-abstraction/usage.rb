    # Subclass of <tt>Input</tt> providing methods and attributes appropriate for
    # representing adjustable calculation usages specifically.
    # 
    # Only one instance of <i>Usage</i> can be assocaited with a particular
    # calucaltion object. When the value of <tt>self</tt> is changed, profile
    # item value terms which are forbidden in the new usage will be inactivated
    # and optional/compulsory flags are set on the remaining terms.
    #
    class Usage < Input

      # Initialization of <i>Usage</i> objects follows that of the parent
      # <i>Input</i> class, with a number of differences.
      #
      # If the parent caluclation already contains a usage term, a <i>TwoUsages</i>
      # exception is raised.
      #
      # The <tt>label<tt> attribute is set by default to <tt>:usage</tt>.
      #
      # The <tt>interface</tt> attribute of <tt>self</tt> is set to
      # <tt>:drop_down</tt> by default, but can be manually configured if
      # required.
      #
      # The <tt>inactive</tt> property of <tt>self</tt> is set to <tt>:invisible</tt>
      # by default.
