  # Remove from the system of known units, the units which are not used or not
  # anticipated to be useful for interacting with AMEE. These either represent
  # physical quantities which are not typically represented in emissions
  # calculations (e.g. redioactivity, thermal resistance) or units which do
  # represent appropriate physical quantities but are relatively obscure or
  # inappropriate (e.g angstrom, calorie, cup, light year).
  #
  # Note: although AMEE supports 8 types of British thermal unit, only one is
  # made available since it is unlikely that users would like to choose between
  # each of the alternatives.
