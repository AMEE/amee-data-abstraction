  # The Unit.<unit_name_symbol_or_label> pattern retrieves the unit which is
  # provided as the (pseudo) method name (using #method_missing). In cases where
  # the named unit does not exist an error is raised. In some cases, however,
  # where the unit can be constructed from a known and compatible unit and prefix
  # combination, it is created but not loaded to the canonical system of units.
  # Therefore, to test for presence or absence of partiuclar units, we check that
  # the units we want are #loaded? and that the ones we don't want are either NOT
  # #loaded? (if the happen to be derivable) or otherwise raise an error.
